            <p>As Hydroponic vertical gardens become accessible, a decentralized agricultural paradigm becomes possible. In addition to the actual cultivating technology, an accompanying decentralized market is integral to the
                sustained success and longevity of a new agricultural system. Allowing people to easily sell their own grown produce helps to financially incentivize food independence, improve people's access to healthy foods,
                reduce food wastage through market efficiency, and help reduce transportation distance for produce.
